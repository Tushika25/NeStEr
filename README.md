# NeStEr
Built an CNN model for school students to design their own art work of loitering around with 2 different pictures and combining them to generate a single master piece. Used VGG Network, NST and tensorflow to build it.
# Neural style transfer
Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.

This is implemented by optimizing the output image to match the content statistics of the content image and the style statistics of the style reference image. These statistics are extracted from the images using a convolutional network.
The code sees the implementation of neural style transfer technique and is one of the bes projects I have worked on!!
The code takes in 2 images as an input and returns a third image which is a blend (combination) of them both.
